            <h3>Teacher and entrepreneur</h3>
            <p>Teaching is one of the noblest professions anyone can opt for, and those who do it are called teachers.
                Teachers are often very dedicated and knowledgeable, and they gladly pour their knowledge for the better
                education of children.An entrepreneur is a person who organizes a venture to benefit from an
                opportunity, rather than working as an employee. Entrepreneurs play a key role in any economy. These are
                the people who have the skills and initiative necessary to anticipate current and future needs and bring
                good new ideas to market. </p>
